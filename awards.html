					Houston won numerous accolades, including 2 Emmy Awards, 6 Grammy Awards, 2 Grammy Hall of Fame honors, 14 World Music Awards, 16 Billboard Music Awards and 22 American Music Awards. Houston holds the record for the most American Music Awards received in a single year by a woman with eight wins in 1994 (overall tied with Michael Jackson).[378] Houston won a record 11 Billboard Music Awards at its fourth ceremony in 1993.[379]

She also had the record for the most WMAs won in a single year, winning five awards at the sixth World Music Awards in 1994.[380] In 2001, Houston was the first artist to be given a BET Lifetime Achievement Award.[381] Since she received the honor at just the age of 37 at the time, Houston was and remains the youngest artist to receive this. Five years earlier, in 1996, Houston became the second recipient of the BET Walk of Fame and was, at 32, the youngest to receive that honor.

					She is the first and only black artist to have three Diamond-certified albums. Houston's first two albums, as well as her 1992 release The Bodyguard's soundtrack, are among the best-selling albums of all time. The Bodyguard (soundtrack) remains the best-selling soundtrack album of all time, with global sales of over 45 million copies. Houston's "I Will Always Love You" became the best-selling physical single by a female in music history, with sales of over 20 million copies worldwide. Her 1996 soundtrack for The Preacher's Wife is the best-selling gospel album of all time.

In 1997, the Franklin School in East Orange, New Jersey was renamed to The Whitney E. Houston Academy School of Creative and Performing Arts. She held an honorary Doctorate in Humanities from Grambling State University, Louisiana.[395] Houston was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2013.[396] In August 2014, she was inducted into the official Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in its second class.[397] In October 2019, Houston was announced as a 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominee, one of nine first-time nominees and 16 total.[398]

On January 15, 2020, she was announced as an inductee into the Hall's 2020 class, along with five other acts.[399] In March 2020, the Library of Congress announced that Houston's 1992 single "I Will Always Love You" had been added to its National Recording Registry, a list of "aural treasures worthy of preservation" due to their "cultural, historical and aesthetic importance" in the American soundscape.[400] In October 2020, the music video for "I Will Always Love You" surpassed 1 billion views on YouTube, making Houston the first solo 20th-century artist to have a video reach that milestone.[401]
