				<p>
					Whitney Elizabeth Houston was born on August 9, 1963, in what was then a middle-income neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey.
					[5] She was the daughter of ex-Army serviceman and Newark city administrator John Russell Houston Jr. and gospel 
					singer Emily "Cissy" (Drinkard) Houston.[6][7] Her elder brother Michael is a songwriter and her elder half-brother 
					is former basketball player and singer Gary Garland.[8][9] Her parents were both African-American and she is said to have 
					had Dutch and Native American ancestry.[10] Through her mother, Houston was a first cousin of singers Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick. 
					Her godmother was Darlene Love[11] and her honorary aunt was Aretha Franklin,[12][13] whom she met at age eight or nine when her mother 
					took her to a recording studio.[12] Houston was raised a Baptist, but was also exposed to the Pentecostal church. After the 1967 Newark riots, 
					the family moved to a middle-class area in East Orange, New Jersey, when she was four.[14] Her parents later divorced.[15]
					<br><br>
					While Houston was still in school, her mother, Cissy, continued to teach her how to sing.[18] Cissy was a member of the group the Sweet Inspirations which also opened for and sang backup for Elvis Presley.[19] Houston spent some of her teens touring nightclubs where Cissy was performing and she would occasionally get onstage and perform with her. Houston was also exposed to the music of Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight and Roberta Flack, most of whom would have an influence on her as a singer and performer.[20] In 1977, aged 14, she became a backup singer on the Michael Zager Band's single "Life's a Party".[21] When she was around 16, Houston sang background vocals for Chaka Khan and Lou Rawls on their 1980 albums, Naughty and Shades of Blue, respectively.[22]

Houston attended Mount Saint Dominic Academy, a Catholic girls' high school in Caldwell, New Jersey; she graduated in 1981.[23] During her teens, Houston met Robyn Crawford, who she described as the "sister she never had".[24][25] Crawford went on to become Houston's best friend, roommate and executive assistant.[26][25][27] After Houston rose to stardom, she and Crawford were rumored to be lovers, which they both denied in 1987.[25] In 2019, several years after Houston's death, Crawford stated that their early relationship had included sexual activity, but that Houston ended this for fear of others' reactions.[2
<br><br>
In the early 1980s, Houston began working as a fashion model after a photographer saw her at Carnegie Hall singing with her mother. She became one of the first women of color to appear on the cover of Seventeen;[29] she appeared in Glamour, Cosmopolitan and Young Miss and appeared in a Canada Dry soft drink TV commercial.[22] Her looks and girl-next-door charm made her one of the most sought-after teen models.[22] In 1982, under the suggestion of longtime friend Valerie Simpson, Houston signed with Tara Productions and hired Daniel Gittleman, Seymour Flics and Gene Harvey as her managers. With them, Houston furthered her recording career by working with producers Michael Beinhorn, Bill Laswell and Martin Bisi on an album they were spearheading called One Down, which was credited to the group Material. For that project, she contributed the ballad "Memories", a cover of a song by Hugh Hopper of Soft Machine. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice called her contribution "one of the most gorgeous ballads you've ever heard".[30] She also appeared as a lead vocalist on one track on a Paul Jabara album, entitled Paul Jabara and Friends, released by Columbia Records in 1983.[31]

In 1983, Gerry Griffith, an A&R representative from Arista Records, saw Houston performing with her mother in a New York nightclub. He convinced Arista's head Clive Davis to make time to see her perform. Davis was impressed and immediately offered a worldwide record deal, which Houston eventually signed after being alternatively sought after by another label.[6] (Houston had been offered deals by recording agencies before—by Michael Zager in 1980 and by Elektra Records in 1981—but her mother declined them on the grounds that Whitney had yet to complete high school.[21][32]) Later that year, Houston made her national television debut alongside Davis on The Merv Griffin Show.[33] She performed "Home", a song from the musical The Wiz.[34]
