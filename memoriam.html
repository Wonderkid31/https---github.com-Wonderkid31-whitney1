				<p>
					Fans of Whitney Houston have been mourning the loss of their idol since it was reported that the she died on Feb. 11.

The legendary singer was found dead in her hotel bath tub on the eve of the 54th Grammy Awards Night which she would have been attending.

Since Saturday, friends and fans alike have paid their respects and honored the passing of an extremely talented woman.

At the Grammys, the show’s host, LL Cool J, shared a heartfelt prayer in memory of Whitney Houston, saying, “Although she is gone too soon, we remain truly blessed to have been touched by her beautiful spirit.”

Another tribute was made to Whitney Houston in the form of a song sung by Jennifer Hudson. Hudson sang a simple rendition of the classic, “I Will Always Love You” but ending the song by singing, “Whitney, we will always love you.”

The stars at the Grammys aren’t the only ones mourning the loss of Houston. Thousands of tweets have been made from Houston’s fans around the world, showing their love and hoping for her to rest in peace. Choir members at Second Baptist Church celebrated the life of Whitney Houston Sunday with a tribute during a church service.

Melissa Wood, a sophomore at Carlmont, said, “She had such an amazing voice and such a great vocal range. All the attention being given to her passing reminds me of when Michael Jackson died, both very sad.”

Just as Michael Jackson was called the King of Pop, some referred to Whitney Houston as the Queen of Pop. She was one of the artists that broke down the barriers of black, female signers as she was one of the few black singers of the time to be played in heavy rotation on  networks.

Whitney Houston held the Guinness World Record for the most awarded female artist of all time with a total of 415 career awards as of 2010, including two Emmy Awards, six Grammy Awards, 30 Billboard Music Awards, and 22 American Music Awards.

While Houston has passed away, her legacy and influence on the music industry and its artists continues on. Stars such as Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey have expressed how much of inspiration Houston was to them and what a profound influence she had on them.

Whether it be friends, family, fellow stars, or fans, many people are grieving over the loss of Whitney Houston, an extremely talented and influential women.
